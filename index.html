        <p>Robert 'Bobby' Axelrod is the CEO of Axe Capital</p>
        <p>A multibillion dollar hedge fund originally located in Connecticut</p>
        <p> before moving to New York City in Season 3. </p>
        <p> Known as "Axe" by friends and enemies alike, Bobby is an incredibly smart</p>
        <p>and capable investor, able to see many moves ahead in his investments and </p>
        <p>appearing to come out ahead every time.</p>
        <p> He is hardly ever on the losing side, and his intelligence, shrewdness, and decisive</p>
        <p>  leadership often win him the awe and respect of friends and enemies. </p>
        <p>  His intelligence and power also pull double to hide his nature as a ruthless and vindictive</p>
        <p> player that takes no prisoners, causing many to fear his wrath should they ever cross him.</p>
        <p> Bobby is an incredibly smart and shrewd investor and has a reputation of being entirely</p>
        <p>  self-made in creating his wealth, though many are skeptical of his</p> 
        <p>initial gains after 9/11. He did have enough foresight to use the gains he earned with</p>
        <p> those trades to pay for the college tuition of all the kids of his friends and</p>
        <p>  bosses lost in the tragedy, indicating some need to be philanthropic.</p>
        <p> He has been able to connect the dots for many pieces on whichever board</p>
        <p>  he is playing on, which others have not been able to do,indicating a strong </p>
        <p>  strategic mindset and an ability to think several steps ahead. </p>
        <p>  This has often been to the detriment of Chuck Rhodes</p>
        <p>and other law enforcement, who hardly ever concretely tie anything to him.</p>
